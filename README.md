# PWSbUV-prox
Proxy Web Serach Engine b made with Ultraviolet

Proxy Web Serach Engine b made with Ultraviolet (PWSbUV) is a web proxy made with Ultraviolet (more about it below).
if you want to use PWSbUV please give us (me and titaniumnetwork founders of Ultraviolet) credit as stuff like this takes time, (if you edit the html css etc do only give titaniumnetwork founders of Ultraviolet credit as I only developed the interface)

I have no association with titaniumnetwork
